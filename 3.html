<h2>Production</h2>
<p>As a drummer, Damien Chazelle has a predilection for musical films.[7] He wrote the screenplay for La La Land in 2010, when the film industry seemed out of reach for him.[8] His idea was "to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out,"[7] and to salute creative people who move to Los Angeles to chase their dreams.[9] He conceived the film when he was a student at Harvard University with his classmate Justin Hurwitz. The two explored the concept in their senior thesis through a low-budget musical about a Boston jazz musician, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench.[10][11] Chazelle was moved by the tradition of 1920s city symphony films, such as Manhattan (1921) and Man with a Movie Camera (1929), that paid tribute to cities.[12] After graduating, both moved to Los Angeles in 2010 and continued writing the script, but made a few modifications, such as altering the location to Los Angeles instead of Boston</p>
